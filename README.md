# Regenerative Brake System for Bicycles  

## Project Overview  
Designed and built a regenerative braking system to capture kinetic energy lost during bicycle braking, converting it into electrical energy stored in an external battery. The system integrates mechanical and electrical subsystems, controlled by a custom Arduino-based PCB.  

## Key Responsibilities (Team Manager)  
- Led a **cross-functional team** (mechanical/electrical engineers) through design, prototyping, and testing.  
- Developed the **Control Unit** using **Arduino** and **C#**, ensuring seamless integration of sensors, energy storage, and braking logic.  
- Designed **PCB layouts** and managed **system wiring** for reliability and safety.  
- Facilitated team collaboration to troubleshoot issues and meet all testing benchmarks.  

## Technical Highlights  
- **Energy Conversion:** Mechanical braking force → electrical energy → battery storage.  
- **Control System:** Arduino firmware for real-time monitoring and power regulation.  
- **PCB Design:** Custom board for signal processing and component interfacing.
